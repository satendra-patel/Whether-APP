Welcome to the README file for the Weather App, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This Weather App allows users to search for the weather forecast of any city across the world. It displays the current temperature, weather condition, and wind speed of the city, along with the weather forecast for the next five days.

To use the app, simply open the "index.html" file in your web browser. You will see a search bar where you can enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for. Once you hit the "search" button, the app will fetch the current weather data from the OpenWeather API and display it on the screen.

The app is built using HTML for the structure of the page, CSS for styling the page, and JavaScript for handling user interactions and fetching data from the API.

Here's a breakdown of the files in the project:

index.html: The main HTML file for the app.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
app.js: The JavaScript file for handling user interactions and fetching data from the API.
images: A folder containing the images used in the app.
To make changes to the app, you can edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a text editor. You can also customize the app's appearance by editing the CSS file.

If you encounter any issues with the app or have any suggestions for improvement, 

Thank you for using our Weather App!
